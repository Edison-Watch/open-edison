# UI Implementation Rules

- Reuse existing UI components from `/frontend/src/components/ui`; these are the primitives we can build with.
- Create new components by orchestrating UI components if you can't find any existing that solves the problem.
- Ask the human how they want to proceed when there are missing components and designs.
