## Single-User Design Philosophy

Open Edison is deliberately designed for single-user deployment. Always maintain this focus.

### Core Principles

- **One user, one instance** - No multi-tenancy
- **Local deployment** - Designed for self-hosting
- **Simple authentication** - Single API key, no user management
- **JSON configuration** - No database complexity
- **Process management** - Subprocess over containers

### What NOT to add

❌ User management systems  
❌ Database migrations  
❌ Complex authentication  
❌ Multi-tenant features  
❌ Organization/team features  

### What to maintain

✅ Simple API key authentication  
✅ JSON configuration file  
✅ Process-based MCP server management  
✅ Single-port server architecture  
✅ Local file storage  

### Code Patterns

```python
# Good: Simple API key check
def verify_api_key(credentials):
    if credentials.credentials != config.server.api_key:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Invalid API key")

# Bad: Complex user lookup
# def get_user_by_token(token): ...
```

When in doubt, choose the simpler approach that works for one user on one machine.
